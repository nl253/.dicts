# Dictionaries

Dictionaries I managed to collect and generate using a python script that I wrote <https://github.com/nl253/DictGen>

-   frequent.dict

      Generated using my DictGen script from analysing word frequencies of:

        	+ All Harry Potter books (for regular english words)
        	+ A few man pages
        	+ A few computer science textbooks

      The words have been 'normalised', numbers removed, case removed, very, very
      high quality.

-   css.dict

      This one is very good as well.

-   erlang.dict

-   haskell.dict

-   java.dict

-   javascript.dict

-   perl.dict

-   php.dict

-   python.dict

    > This one I got from someone on GitHub but tbh it is a little bit too
    > `complete`.  2.4 MB is an overkill and you will see a lot of redundant
    > sections from external libraries, frameworks you might not use ... 
    > My advice, stick to omnicompletion from jedi or rope.

-   shell.dict (tiny)

-   sql.dict

    > Also generated by me, it looks decent, it only includes upper case entries.
    > Because sql is not a particularly larg language it only includes about 400
    > entries.

-   thesaurus.txt

      An amazing thesaurus, highly recommended.

-   en.utf-8.add

      Extra spelling entries from vim

```vim
let g:MARKUP = [ 'markdown', 'rst' ]
" LIST OF MARKUP FILETYPES THAT YOU WANT THIS TO WORD FOR

function! Init()
    if index(g:MARKUP, &filetype) >= 0 
    " RETURNS -1 if NOT in the list so it evaluates to FALSE
        setlocal complete=.,w,k,s,k~/Notes/**.md,k~/Notes/**.rst
    endif
    " You might want to add else and add tag completion for non-markup filetypes
endfunction

" YOU CAN HAVE A SEPARATE AUTOCOMMAND FOR EACH FILETYPE BUT WHEN YOU WORK WITH
" MANY MARKUP FORMATS IT ENDS UP BEING MESSY

" eg 
"
" au! FileType markdown,rst,tex,......  setlocal spell complete=.,w,k,s,k~/Notes/**.md,k~/Notes/**.rst

au! FileType * call Init()
```

What this will do is add to user defined completion (CTRL-N CTRL-P) words from
these paths (~/Notes/\*\*.{rst,md} in my case). Now you will get completion for
things you have written before, like places, words you made up, and your name,
address etc.
